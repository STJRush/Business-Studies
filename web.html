<A NAME="why"></A>
	<h3 class="margin">Why is it Important</h3>
  <p>Young people are growing up in a globalised and dynamic world. New opportunities and challenges will emerge in their lifetimes that are virtually unimaginable today. Developing technologies, environmental and societal challenges, demographics, global competition and changing consumer demand will drive these changes. 
	  Studying business helps to equip students with the understanding, skills and attitudes to participate fully in an interconnected world. <br>
	  
Business studies encourages students to develop an appreciation of how their lives are shaped by economic and social factors.  
	  They are enabled to make informed decisions, to better manage their personal financial resources and to be adaptable, creative, and enterprising. Business studies also improves their knowledge and understanding of good business practice and of business as a productive activity.<br>

Entrepreneurship enhances the quality of our collective and individual lives, often changing the way we work, communicate and live. Business studies provides an awareness, insight and positive attitude to entrepreneurship, demonstrating how it can improve our goods, services and institutions.
<br>	  
Business studies encourages students to develop skills for learning, skills for work and skills for life. It supports the development of analytical and critical thinking skills, encouraging students to be problem solvers. It reinforces the development of students’ numeracy, literacy and digital technology skills by providing a real-life context for their application. <br>
Business studies explores the interdependence of economic prosperity, societal well-being and the environment and encourages students to think and act as responsible and ethical citizens. <br>
	  They will be provided with a set of foundational skills, understandings and personal attributes, which will help them to engage with the dynamic business environment and fulfil their potential in their personal and professional lives, now and into the future. </p><br>

	<h3>Learning Outcomes and Assessment:</h3>
	<p>There are 37 learning outcomes across the three
strands and teachers select learning outcomes from
across the strands in first, second and third year.
Learning outcomes describe the knowledge and
understanding, skills and values that students
should be able to demonstrate having studied
Junior Cycle Business Studies.<br>The purpose of assessment and reporting at this
stage of education is to support and improve
learning. The junior cycle places a strong emphasis
on assessment as part of the learning process and
supports a more varied approach to assessment.
Assessment in Junior Cycle Business Studies will
optimise the opportunity for students to become
reflective and active participants in their learning.
The students will be supported through effective
feedback that they will receive throughout their
learning journey.<br> Assessment in Junior Cycle is designed to give a
broader picture of student learning. In addition to
the ongoing supportive feedback provided to
progress student learning, there are a number of
key assessment moments in second and third year.<br><strong>Classroom-Based Assessment 1:
Business in Action</strong><br>
Classroom-Based Assessment (CBA) 1 takes
place at the end of second year and students
have a four week period to complete this CBA.
It is to be completed in groups of three to five
students and there are three options available:
Enterprise in Action, Economics in Action or
Finance in Action.<br><strong>Classroom-Based Assessment 2:
Presentation</strong><br>
Junior Cycle Business Studies
Information for Teachers
The new specification for Business Studies has
three interconnected strands.
Personal Finance focuses on students making
informed decisions to effectively and responsibly
manage their financial resources.
Enterprise encourages students to identify
opportunities and develops an understanding of
the financial, marketing and operational functions
of an organisation.
Our Economy enables students to understand the
dynamic relationship between the local, national
and international economic situation.
The Three Strands of Junior Cycle Business Studies:<br>
● Takes place at the end of the first term in third
year over a three week period.<br>
● Individual presentation of 3 minute duration.<br>
● Provides an opportunity for students to apply
their knowledge, skills and understanding to
real life settings while also developing their
communication skills.<br>
After completion of each CBA, a Subject Learning
and Assessment Review (SLAR) meeting takes
place to discuss student learning and share
effective practice.<br>
<strong>Assessment Task</strong><br>
● Following the second Classroom-Based
Assessment in third year students complete a
reflective Assessment Task.<br>
● The Assessment Task is assessed by the State
Examinations Commission (SEC). It will be
allocated 10% of the marks used to determine
the final examination grade awarded by the
SEC.
<br>
<strong>Final Examination</strong><br>
● Takes place at the end of third year as normal,
and is set and assessed by the SEC.<br>
● One examination paper offered at common
level. <br>
● Maximum of two hours in duration.</p><br>
